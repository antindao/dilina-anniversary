       <h1>Happy 6 Year Anniversary!!!</h1>


        <img src="images/spongebob.gif" class="center">

        <p> This marks our progress at 60% towards 10 years goddamn</p>
        <p> We always write letters to each other every anniversary so I thought I would make it really interesting
            and turn it into a coding project to spice things up lol. Take this "letter" as a metaphor for the times
            over the years, where you have inspired me to go out and try new things, learn skills, progress my life in general.
            Here I am, literally using my new found knowledge of coding to create this letter and honestly I wouldn't haven't attempted
            to do something like this on my own without the support you have given me.
            A year ago today, I thought Samsung was where I would stay for years and that I would be just living my life in Austin
            around this time. But again, you exposed me to all the possibilities that life has to offer. This really has been my best year ever.
            I met so many amazing and successful people through you which got me looking for more lucrative yet impactful career
            opportunities. Even though I always wanted to work at AMD, the experiences in NY with just seeing
            how everyone else is having better WLB really puts it into perspective. It got me thinking that
            I too could have an enjoyable life with meaningful work. You let me experience NYC
            not as a tourist but as a local. Going out to eat and doing whatever we wanted without feeling that urgency to go to all touristy spots.
            Back then, I always dreamed of living in NYC, partying it up, meeting interesting people,
            feeling like I was the center of the universe. Now I genuinely believe that I can make that dream a reality.
            This coding project letter is just one step towards that better life.
        </p>
  
        <p>
           Whenever you had asked me why I liked you, I could never respond adequately.
           It was not because I couldn't think of anything. We have been together for so long, there was no way in hell that
           I couldn't come up with one thing. I was just too prideful and play these retarded ass mind games even though it
           shouldn't have even mattered or been a thing. I was way too immature at the time and realize now how important it
           is to always give your significant other words of affirmation. Just saying that simple things
           like you looked good in that outfit or you looked hot today would have been enough to make your day and I took that for
           granted. I took your happiness for granted.
  
           <h4>I wanted to let you know in this letter why I love you so much and finally list them out for you to see:</h4>
  
           <ul>
                <li>You are the most beautiful woman I have ever met and no one else could compare to you. Like I get turned on
                    everytime I see you. I never told you in the past and I have been trying to make up for it lately.
                </li>
                <li>You are seriously funny ( I know I always tell you that you aren't but, I am just too prideful to say you are since
                    you might get the wrong idea that you are funnier than me lol)
                </li>
                <li>You are ambitious and outgoing. I know this because you worked so hard to get where you are today.
                    Look at how much effort you put into stacking up your achievements during your MBA. I should have let you know
                    at the time how proud I was of you when you won that one competition (forgot the name) for Juno. I'm sure
                    you wanted me to recognize your achievements when you got them but I regret not reacting to it the way a
                    typical supportive boyfriend should have.
                </li>
                <li> You really fucking smart. Like dude you always try to say that I am smart but you are really on another level
                     You fucking went to an IVY LEAGUE. You pick up things faster than I do ( remember digital logic / binary?).
                     You know so much more trivia than me. Like I always get destroyed in crosswords and jeopardy lol.
                      You got a 35 on the ACT??? Only 1 other person I know  who scored has scored that high.
                     You got a full fucking ride scholarship at OU and I couldn't even get one for my undergrad.
                     You are a better abstract thinker than I am and most people I know. You got 2 degrees quicker than I got my
                     single undergrad one.
                </li>
                <li>You make me feel so special and that I am the only person that matters.</li>
                <li>You constantly compliment me and give me praise</li>
                <li>You are so kind and generous. You have done countless numbers of favors for me while I barely do anything Back
                    for you. You always took me to my morning exams to help me squeeze in more studying even though you have to wake up
                    so early and have to drive to my house to pick me up. Like those have helped me so much in getting better grades on those exams.
                    I don't think I would've passed some classes if you had not done it for me.
                    Everytime I have asked you to do me a favor, you always are willing to do it without any hesitation.
                 </li>
                 <li>You are thoughtful. You gave me one of the most memorable gifts I have ever received. (Travis Scott Concert)
                    You always are thinking about what makes me happy. You make sure that I feel loved during the moments that count.
                    Remember when you threw me that surprise birthday party and invited all of my friends? I still remember it as one of the best
                    birthdays to this day because of how crazy it was. I feel really ashamed for not telling you how much it meant to me at the time and
                    even not acknowledging you enough for being the person behind it.
                 </li>
                 <li> You overcome all your obstacles. You worked as a lowly data analyst at some shit ass company in oklahoma. Now you work as
                    a strategy consultant in NYC. You do not get here by luck. You got here because you were determined to make this
                    life for yourself. You studied really hard for those 2-3 weeks of casing. I remember how you and soomin would make sure to
                    schedule a few days where you would case each other for hours. That was not the only thing, you were determined to make this
                    shift ever since you started working at ISS. You realized what you needed to do and planned the necessary steps to move forward.
                    You quit your job, went back to school for an MBA, did all the entrepreneurial and extracurricular activities possible at OU,
                    did projects that you knew would be valuable to your career. You have been planning this for so long and if that is not fucking determination
                    than I don't know what is.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    How much you love food. We always are planning our next meal even though we just finished eating something. Food is always on our mind
                    and I love that we are never not down for.
                 </li>
                <li>
                    You mean the world to me and I never tell you enough.
                </li>
           </ul>
  
           All of these things, I may or may not have mentioned before but like I want to reiterate again to let you know that
           I love you so much and that nothing you do goes unnoticed. I may have downplayed you in the past and
           I regret doing it everytime I think about it. I downplayed just to play as some retarded ass villian and that I had to go against
           you for no goddamn apparent reason but just to antagonize. You always compare yourself to other people when you shouldn't.
           Hold your head up high and be proud. You hit every single damn goal you have ever set for yourself. Once you put your mind to it, You
           literally somehow make it possible. There are so many more things I could list but don't want to make it too long for you to read lol.
           I could never do half of the things you could do. I could never be half the things you are.
  
        </p>
  
        <p>
            For a long time in our relationship, I have always treated you so poorly. Ignoring your texts, not picking up calls, not doing little
            simple things to just make your day, and just making you feel alone in the world. We were together and I still made you feel the
            loneliest that you have ever felt. I was just a shitty ass deadbeat boyfriend who didn't deserve you. I still do not deserve you.
            You have given me the best years of my life and all of the things I have done to you could never be forgiven. It hurts me so much
            knowing that you had to go through all of that pain, emotional suffering, and mental anguish alone for so many years
            while I only cared about whether or not I had time to play stupid ass videogames. To this day, I don't get how you are still with me.
        
        </p>
            <p>You are more than my girlfriend, you are my bestfriend and you are family to me.
            I don't think I could possibly love someone more than you.</p>
  
            <p>I love you so fucking much that it fucking hurts.</p>

            <p>Happy Anniversary babe! You really were the best thing to happen to my life!</p>
