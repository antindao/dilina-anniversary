        <h1>Happy 6 Year Anniversary!!!</h1>
        <img src="images/spongebob.gif">
        <p> This marks our progress at 60% towards 10 years goddamn</p>
        <p> We always write letters to each other every anniversary so I thought I would make it really interesting
            and turn it into coding project to spice things up lol. Take this "letter" as a metaphor for times where
            over the years, where you have inspired me to go out and try new things, learn skills, progress my life in general.
            Here I am literally using my new found knowledge of coding to create this letter and it really is all thanks to you.
            A year ago today, I thought Samsung was where I would stay for years and that I would be enjoying my life in Austin 
            around this time. But again, ou have exposed me to all the possiblities that life has to offer to me.
